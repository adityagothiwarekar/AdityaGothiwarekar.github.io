        <div class="font">
            <p>Over the time, the majority of educational institutions have continued to use traditional approach of manual attendance management which is time consuming and difficult for teachers to track large number of daily records with loads of paperwork. • This manual process uses a lot of paper & ink thus increasing the overall cost of running an institution.</p> 
        
            <p>• It is a time-consuming process.
            </p>
            <p>• Huge storage system will be required to keep all the paperwork organized thus utilizing the institution’s space.</p>
            <p>• In some cases, the attendance is first recorded on paper and then put into the software system used by the management leading to more unnecessary paper wastage.</p>
            <p>• This manual form also makes it tedious to generate any report of the data that is being stored.
            </p>
            <p>Barriers Are:</p> lack of an independent system to automate all this process.
            
            The system that we have developed is keeping the aim of “Save the resources and time of the institutions and their professors by automating this process with the help of a desktop application.”</p> 
           <span>Project scope</span>
            <p>Project Scope Scope of our project lies in:</p>
            <p>This system can be used for a particular institute by setting up the desktop application in PCs used by Staffs as well as Admin
                Can be used offline but later on the project can be modified into a web application as well to operate it online.
                Teachers’ login, options to add new/ review attendance, Obtaining reports in statistical/ graphical format.
                A portal for students to have an access to their detailed attendance report on their own is beyond our scope for this project.</p>
